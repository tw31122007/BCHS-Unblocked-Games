<p>Our Services enable you to explore math. You can use our calculators and tools to graph functions, plot tables of data, evaluate equations, explore transformations, construct and represent geometric relationships, and much more. You can use our classroom activities and curricula to create, teach and learn mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and to the collection, processing and use of your information as described in our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not permitted to use our Services.</p>
<p>Our Services include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<strong>Desmos Tools</strong>”: these are our tools on www.desmos.com, including the <a href="/calculator">Graphing Calculator</a>, <a href="/scientific">Scientific Calculator</a>, <a href="/fourfunction">Four Function Calculator</a>, <a href="/geometry">Geometry Tool</a>, and future standalone tools to come. This term also includes any apps associated with those tools, including (i) the Desmos Graphing application, available on Android and iOS; (ii) the Desmos Scientific Calculator application, available on Android and iOS; and (iii) the Desmos Test Mode application, available on iOS for iPads.</li>
<li>“<strong>Desmos Classroom</strong>”: which includes all our services (i) on <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com">https://teacher.desmos.com</a> (“teacher.desmos.com”) including those for creating and assigning activities (“Activities”) and the Desmos provided curriculum available via <a href="https://desmos.com/curriculum">www.desmos.com/curriculum</a> (“Desmos Math Curriculum”), and (ii) on <a href="https://student.desmos.com">https://student.desmos.com</a> (“student.desmos.com”), specifically, those for the use of activities or curricula as directed by an instructor on teacher.desmos.com. The services on teacher.desmos.com are designed to be managed by providers of educational services, such as schools, school districts, school systems, teachers or other instructors (collectively referred to as &quot;Schools&quot;) for the benefit of students of such Schools (“Students”).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="eligibility">2. Eligibility and Authority</h2>
<p>If you are (i) using Desmos Classroom on behalf of a School in connection with provision of access to Students at student.desmos.com or (ii) you are using Desmos Tools on behalf of a School and/or directing Students to use the Desmos Tools, then you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the School and you agree to these Terms on the School’s behalf. In addition, in such circumstance, each reference to “you” in these Terms shall be deemed to refer to the School. Each such School hereby agrees it is responsible for the use of the Desmos Services by such School’s personnel and Students in accordance with these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We require that all Schools provide appropriate disclosures to Students and their parents/guardians regarding use of Desmos. Please note that if your Students are under the age of digital consent in the applicable jurisdiction (the age of 13 in the U.S., in accordance with Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”)), you must obtain verifiable parental/guardian consent to the Terms and our Privacy Policy prior to your Students’ use of our Services. If you are acting on behalf of a School that is providing access to Students or directing Student to access the Service, then you, on behalf of the School, represent and warrant that the School has received verifiable consent from the parent or guardian of the Student, or has gained the authority to provide consent on behalf of Students, for these Terms and our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using our Services independently from a School, then you agree to these Terms on your own behalf.</p>
<h2 id="personal-information">3. Personal Information and Student Data</h2>
<p>This Section 3 applies to a School’s use of the Desmos Classroom through teacher.desmos.com and student.desmos.com. If you are a School teacher, Student, or parent/guardian of a Student, you may also refer to the <a href="/studentdata">Student Data Privacy Statement</a>, and if executed by the School and Desmos, our <a href="/privacy#contact-us">School Data Processing Addendum</a> (“<strong>DPA</strong>”).</p>
<p>When Desmos is used by a School for an educational purpose, Desmos may collect or have access to Student Data that is provided by the School or by the Student. “Student Data” is personal information that is directly related to an identifiable Student and may include “educational records” as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“<strong>FERPA</strong>”), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g).</p>
<p><em>Confidentiality</em>.
Desmos agrees to treat Student Data as confidential and not to share it with third parties other than as described in these Terms, and in our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="/studentdata">Student Data Privacy Statement</a>, and if executed by the School and Desmos, our DPA.</p>
<p><em>Student Data Access</em>.
You authorize Desmos to access or collect Student Data for the purpose of providing the Services. In the U.S., Desmos shall collect and process Student Data as a School Official with a legitimate educational interest pursuant to FERPA 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(1). As between the parties, the School or the Student owns and controls the Student Data. Desmos does not own or control, or license such Student Data, except as to provide the Service and as described in these Terms, our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="/studentdata">Student Data Privacy Statement</a>, and if executed by the School and Desmos, our DPA.</p>
<p><em>Personal Information and Student Data Consents and Authority</em>.
If you are a School representative, you represent and warrant that you have provided appropriate disclosures to your School and to parents regarding your sharing such personal information with Desmos. Both the School and Desmos hereby agree to uphold their respective obligations under FERPA, the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (&quot;<strong>PPRA</strong>&quot;), COPPA and applicable State laws relating to student data privacy, and if executed by your school and Desmos, our <a href="/privacy#contact-us">School Data Processing Addendum</a>. Desmos relies on each School to obtain and provide appropriate consent and disclosures, if necessary, for Desmos to collect any Student Data, including the collection of Student Data directly from Students under the age of 13, or the applicable age of digital majority in the Student’s jurisdiction. We recommend that Schools provide a copy of the Desmos <a href="/studentdata">Student Data Privacy Statement</a> to each Student’s parent/guardian. Each School hereby agrees to comply with these Terms and all laws and regulations governing the protection of personal information, including children’s information, and the sharing of student education records.</p>
<p><em>Use of Student Data</em>.
By submitting or providing us access to Student Data, you agree that Desmos may use the Student Data solely for the purposes of (i) providing the Service, (ii) improving and developing our Service, (iii) enforcing our rights under these Terms, and (iv) as permitted with the School’s consent. <strong>Desmos shall not use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Use of Anonymized Student Data</em>.
You agree that we may collect and use data derived from Student Data for our own purposes, such as for product development, research analytics, and marketing our Service, provided that (i) such data will be de-identified and/or aggregated to reasonably avoid identification of a specific individual and (ii) Desmos will seek to impose contractual limits on any third parties with access to de-identified data preventing reidentification of de-identified data.</p>
<p><em>Use of Personal Information for Marketing</em>.
You agree that Desmos may provide customized, relevant marketing messaging for Desmos and Desmos partners products and services to Schools or School representatives and teachers from time to time, provided that such advertisements shall not be based on Student Data. For emphasis, and without limitation, Desmos shall never use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising, nor shall Desmos direct advertising to Student users on student.desmos.com.</p>
<p><em>Third-Party Service Providers</em>.
You acknowledge and agree that Desmos may provide access to Student Data to our employees and service providers, which have a legitimate need to access such information in order to provide their services to us. We and our employees, affiliates, service providers, or agents involved in the handling, transmittal, and processing of Student Data will be required to maintain the confidentiality of such Student Data.</p>
<p><em>Student Data Retention and Deletion Requests</em>.
Schools and teachers may (i) delete all Student Data associated with a teacher’s account by deleting the teacher’s account and (ii), delete specific Student Data associated with the teacher’s account by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@desmos.com">privacy@desmos.com</a>. Desmos shall not be required to delete content that a Student has not associated with the School use. We shall respond to the deletion request as soon as possible, but in most instances within 45 days, other than for data stored in logs and backups which shall be deleted in the ordinary course of business. For inactive accounts, we delete or de-identify Student Data in our possession after a period of dormancy or at the request of a parent or guardian. A parent or guardian seeking to modify, correct, or delete personal information of a Student that is connected to an active School account will be instructed to contact the School to discuss data deletion or modification. We are not required to delete data that has been derived from Student Data so long as it has been anonymized such that it does not reasonably identify an individual. Similarly, we are not required to delete, at a School’s request, any information which a Student or parent / guardian has saved or transferred to a personal account.</p>
<p><em>Data Breach Notification</em>.
We have implemented administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to secure Personal Information, including Student Data, from unauthorized access, disclosure and use. In the event we have a reasonable, good faith belief that an unauthorized party has gained access to or been disclosed Student Data (a “<strong>Security Event</strong>”), that we have collected or received through the Service, we will promptly notify the School. If, due to a Security Event which is caused by the acts or omissions of Desmos or its agents, a notification to an individual, organization or government agency is required under applicable privacy laws, the School shall be responsible for the timing, content, and method of any such legally-required notice and compliance with such laws. With respect to any Security Event which is not caused by the acts or omissions of Desmos or its agents, Desmos shall reasonably cooperate with School’s investigation of the Security Event, as School requests, at School’s reasonable expense. Desmos shall be responsible for the timing, content, cost and method of notice and compliance with such laws as they relate to any accounts that are not associated with a School account.</p>

As between Desmos and you, you own all rights to your User Submissions and Generated Materials. You grant to Desmos an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully-paid, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers, to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, and publicly display or otherwise use your User Submissions and Generated Materials (in whole or in part) in connection with the operation of the Service or the promotion, advertising or marketing thereof, in any format or medium now known or later developed, without compensation or notification to or permission from the user of any kind. You acknowledge and agree that all right and title in the software code and other material used to create or display your User Submissions and Generated Materials is the property of Desmos, and you hereby assign all right and title in such material to Desmos. Desmos hereby grants you a license to such material (a) as an end user, for your personal, non-commercial use or (b) as a teacher, for academic use by you and your students in individual classes.

Desmos is not responsible for any loss, theft or damage of any kind to any User Submissions and Generated Materials. You represent and warrant that your User Submissions and Generated Materials, and Desmos' authorized use thereof, do not and will not infringe the rights of any third party (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights, rights of privacy or publicity, or any other legal or moral rights).</p>
<h2 id="schools">7. Special Terms for Schools</h2>
<p>a. <em>Fees</em>.
If Desmos makes any Desmos Service available without charging a fee, then Desmos will not thereafter charge a fee to Schools to use such existing Desmos Service. The foregoing will not, however, prohibit Desmos from removing support for any Desmos Service or from charging a fee for any new Desmos Services that are complementary to, or may be used together with, such existing Desmos Service.</p>
<p>b. <em>Activity Sharing</em>.
At the time you, as a School user, submit to Desmos an activity you’ve developed using the Desmos Activity Builder (an “<strong>Activity</strong>”), you may elect to make your Activity public. If you do so, then you expressly authorize Desmos to (i) make your Activity available to other Schools for use in individual classes with other students, (ii) allow other School users to copy and modify your Activity and use the modified version in individual classes with other students and (iii) modify your Activity and make the modified version available to other School users for use in individual classes with other students. In the case of any such use of your Activity (whether unmodified or modified), you will receive an attribution credit. If you elect to make your Activity public, in no event will Desmos authorize any third party to sell your Activity to others, nor will Desmos sell your activity itself, without your permission.</p>
<p>c. <em>Desmos Curriculum</em>.
The Desmos Math Curriculum is available for purchase by Schools. Please contact to <a href="mailto:curriculum@desmos.com">curriculum@desmos.com</a> for pricing and other information regarding usage of the Desmos Math Curriculum.</p>

<h2 id="termination">10. Termination and Suspension</h2>

You may discontinue your use of the Desmos Services at any time.</p>
<h2 id="fees">11. Fees</h2>
<p>Subject to <a href="#schools">Section 7.a</a> of these Terms, Desmos reserves the right to charge fees for access to new Desmos Services. In no event will you be charged for access to any new Desmos Services, unless Desmos obtains your prior agreement to pay such fees.

You agree to immediately notify Desmos of any unauthorized use of your password or any other breach of security related to the Desmos Services. Desmos may require you to alter your password if Desmos believes that your password is no longer secure.</p>
<h2 id="third-party">13. Third Party Services</h2>
<p>Desmos may integrate with or provide links to certain third party Internet sites and services (collectively, such third parties, “<strong>Linked Partners</strong>”). The Linked Partner services made available through the Desmos Services or the integration of such sites and services with the Desmos Services are for your convenience only and do not signify the endorsement by Desmos of such Partner sites or services.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">14. Disclaimer and Limitations of Liability</h2>
<p><strong>a. You agree that use of the Desmos services is at your sole risk. The Desmos services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Desmos expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, with respect to the Desmos services and all services provided by any of our partner (whether api partners, linked partners, or otherwise), including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular use or purpose, and non-infringement. You acknowledge that access to data and materials (including, but not limited to, your or others’ user submissions and generated materials) available through the Desmos services is not guaranteed and that Desmos will not be responsible to you for any loss of data or materials caused by the Desmos services or their unavailability.

<p><strong>b.

<p><strong>c. If, notwithstanding these Terms, Desmos is found to be liable to you or any third party in connection with your use of the Desmos services, the total liability of Desmos and its officers, employees, directors, shareholders, agents, or licensors to you or to any third party is limited to one hundred U.S. Dollars ($100).</strong></p>
<p>d. <em>Exclusions And Limitations</em>. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent that Desmos may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of Desmos’ liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.</p>
<h2 id="indemnification">15. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Desmos and its officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from your (or anyone using your account's) violation of these Terms. Desmos reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with Desmos’ defense of such claim.</p>

<p><em>Entire Agreement</em>.
These Terms, our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, our <a href="/studentdata">Student Data Privacy Statement</a>, and, if executed by your school and Desmos, our <a href="/privacy#contact-us">School Data Processing Addendum</a>, together with any additional terms to which you agree when using particular elements of the Desmos Services (e.g., terms relating to the payment of fees for certain Desmos Services), constitute the entire and exclusive and final statement of the agreement between you and Desmos with respect to the subject matter hereof, and govern your use of the Desmos Services, superseding any prior agreements or negotiations between you and Desmos with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than to the extent expressly overridden by a written agreement with Desmos.</p>
<p><em>Governing Law</em>.
These Terms and the relationship between you and Desmos will be governed by the laws of the State of California as applied to agreements made, entered into, and performed entirely in California by California residents, notwithstanding your actual place of residence. All lawsuits arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the Desmos Services will be brought in the Federal or State courts located in San Francisco County, California, and you hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts for such purpose.</p>
<p><em>Additional Terms</em>.
The failure of Desmos to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the intentions of Desmos and you as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Desmos Services or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of your use of the Desmos Services. If access to the Desmos Services is licensed to the United States government or any agency thereof, then the Desmos Services will be deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” pursuant to DFARS Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, respectively, as applicable. Any use, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the Desmos Services and any accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by these Terms and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by these Terms.</p>
